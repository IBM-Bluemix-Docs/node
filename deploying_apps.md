# Deploying and integrating Node.js apps
{: #deploy_apps-nodejs}

You can deploy your Node.js apps with a DevOps toolchain or by using the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} Command Line Interface (CLI). A toolchain is a set of tool integrations. The CLI is a simple way to deploy your apps and service instances.

For more information, see [Deploying apps](/docs/apps?topic=apps-deploying-apps).

## Developing serverless Node.js apps
{: #serverless-nodejs}

To facilitate serverless development, you can use the IBM Function as a Service (FaaS) offering, [{{site.data.keyword.openwhisk}}](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/functions){: external}. {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} enables application logic to be run in response to events or direct invocations from web or mobile apps over HTTP without provisioning or managing servers.

{{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} performs system administration, such as availability management and maintenance, allowing developers to remain focused on writing application logic.

For more information, see:
* [Developing serverless apps](/docs/apps?topic=apps-serverless)
* [IBM Cloud Functions](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/functions){: external}
* [FaaS (Function-as-a-Service)](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/faas){: external}

## Deploying to a Kubernetes cluster
{: #deploy-kube}

[{{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}}](/docs/containers?topic=containers-getting-started) is an open source platform for managing containerized workloads and services across multiple hosts, and offers management tools for deploying, automating, monitoring, and scaling containerized apps with minimal to no manual intervention. [Learn more](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/kubernetes).

## Deploying to an OpenShift cluster
{: #deploy-openshift}

[Red Hat OpenShift on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-getting-started) is a Kubernetes container platform that provides a trusted environment to run enterprise workloads. It extends the Kubernetes platform with built-in software to enhance app lifecycle development, operations, and security. With OpenShift, you can consistently deploy your workloads across hybrid cloud providers and environments. [View a comparison between Kubernetes and OpenShift clusters](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-cs_ov#openshift_kubernetes).

## Deploying to {{site.data.keyword.codeenginefull_notm}}
{: #deploy-code-engine}

[{{site.data.keyword.codeenginefull}}](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-getting-started) is a fully managed, serverless platform that runs your containerized workloads, including web apps, micro-services, event-driven functions, or batch jobs. {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} even builds container images for you from your source code. Because these workloads are all hosted within the same Kubernetes infrastructure, all of them can seamlessly work together. The {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} experience is designed so that you can focus on writing code and not on the infrastructure that is needed to host it.

## Deploying to Cloud Foundry
{: #deploy-cf}

[{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Foundry](/docs/cloud-foundry-public?topic=cloud-foundry-public-getting-started) is the premier industry standard Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) that ensures fast, easy, and reliable deployment of cloud-native apps. Cloud Foundry ensures that the build and deploy aspects of coding remain carefully coordinated with any attached services â€” resulting in quick, consistent, and reliable iterating of applications. Cloud Foundry has a Lite plan that allows quick deployments for testing purposes.
